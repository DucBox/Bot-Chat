[['IELTS-Simon‚Äôs video course IELTS Speaking Part 2: describe a person Describe a person you know who does something well. You should say who this person is how you know this person what they do well and explain why you think this person is so good at doing this. Here‚Äôs my example description from the video lesson. It took me exactly 2 minutes, and I simply followed the points above. I tried to use some of my ‚Äòtheme‚Äô language and a good example to demonstrate the ‚Äòhard-working‚Äô theme. I‚Äôm going to describe a friend of mine called James. James is an actor by profession. He‚Äôs in his thirties I think. He‚Äôs tall, he‚Äôs about my height, with dark hair and a friendly face; he‚Äôs always smiling and he cheers me up whenever I see him. I met James in‚Ä¶ at university. He was my next-door neighbour in my hall of residence in the Ô¨Årst year of university. So on that Ô¨Årst day when we were moving in to our rooms, James introduced himself to me and we struck up a conversation, and got to know each other then, and we became good friends. James, as I said, is an actor, and I think he‚Äôs really good at that. He studied drama at university, where I met him, and since then he‚Äôs been working in theatre, he‚Äôs done some small independent Ô¨Ålms, and he‚Äôs trying to get his break in television or in more popular, mainstream Ô¨Ålms. And I think he‚Äôll do it, because for me he seems‚Ä¶ when I‚Äôve been to see him in theatre productions or I‚Äôve seen the short Ô¨Ålms that he‚Äôs been in, he seems to be a really good actor to me. Why I think he‚Äôs good: well, I think it comes from his work ethic. He‚Äôs a really hard worker, he‚Äôs really persistent. He always said he wanted to be a successful actor; it‚Äôs not an easy profession to become successful in, but he has persisted, he‚Äôs really intense, he studies each role very carefully, he gets into character. I remember, for example, not being able to talk to him for about a week before one of his acting jobs because he was ‚Äòin character‚Äô - he didn‚Äôt want to lose focus. So he‚Äôs really intense, and that‚Äôs what I think makes him a great actor, and why I think he‚Äôll be successful. See the next page for notes. IELTS-Simon‚Äôs video course Notes: The best vocabulary is highlighted in bold, italic writing. I think the examiner would be particularly impressed by ‚Äúless common‚Äù items such as: - struck up a conversation - get his break in television (meaning ‚Äòget his Ô¨Årst opportunity‚Äô) - mainstream Ô¨Ålms - his work ethic - he has persisted - he‚Äôs really intense - he gets into character There is a lot of ‚Äòcontent‚Äô, but I don‚Äôt worry about linking. Your focus should be on the task: describing the person using good ideas and vocabulary. Examiners are not impressed by memorised linking phrases! I wasn‚Äôt thinking about grammar, but I naturally used a variety of verb tenses: past, present, present perfect, and future tenses are all used correctly where necessary. Finally, this was my Ô¨Årst attempt. The next step is to go back to my ‚Äòtheme‚Äô vocabulary for ‚Äòhard- working‚Äô and see if I can improve the description. If I did the description a second time, I would try to add words / phrases like: - motivated - determined to succeed - he always sees things through - he likes to challenge himself - he has a magnetic personality']]

User: Just describe 1 person like James for example
Assistant: Sure! Here‚Äôs a description of a person similar to James, following the guidelines provided:

---

I‚Äôd like to describe my friend, Sarah, who is a talented musician. Sarah is in her late twenties, with shoulder-length brown hair, bright green eyes, and a warm smile that makes her approachable. She exudes a kind of creative energy that is hard to ignore. I met Sarah during a community music class a few years ago; we were both interested in learning how to play the guitar, and we bonded over our shared love of music from that moment.

Sarah is an incredibly skilled guitarist and vocalist. She performs regularly at local coffee shops and small venues, and her passion for music truly shines when she‚Äôs on stage. I believe she possesses a rare talent for connecting with her audience; her performances are not just about the music, but about creating an emotional experience for everyone listening.

What makes Sarah so outstanding in her craft is her unwavering dedication. She practices for several hours each day and is constantly seeking to improve her skills. I‚Äôve seen her spend countless nights writing songs, honing lyrics, and perfecting her technique. She‚Äôs inspired me by showing how hard work leads to success, and she embodies the notion of perseverance. For instance, I remember attending one of her gigs where she performed a new song she had written just a week prior; it was incredible to see how she had transformed her ideas into a beautiful composition in such a short time.

In addition to her talent and work ethic, Sarah has a magnetic personality. People are drawn to her positivity and enthusiasm, making every gathering feel lively and vibrant. I truly believe that it‚Äôs this combination of talent, hard work, and charisma that will help her reach new heights in her musical career.
