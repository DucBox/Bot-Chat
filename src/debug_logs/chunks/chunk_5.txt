he was spending on his devices and how it was impacting our friendship. To my surprise, he acknowledged my concerns and agreed that he had been using technology excessively. We made a pact to limit our screen time and to focus more on in-person interactions. Since then, he has made significant improvements. By reducing his social media usage, he has rediscovered his passion for sports and even found time to read more books. This experience taught us both the importance of balance when it comes to technology and how being overly connected can sometimes lead to disconnection with the real world. In summary, the situation with my friend and his excessive use of technology was eye-opening. It highlighted how easy it is to get caught up in the digital world and how important it is to find a balance between online and offline activities. --- ### New Vocabulary and Their Usage 1. **Addicted**: A strong dependency on something, often leading to excessive use. - *Example*: “He became addicted to scrolling through social media, which consumed most of his free time.” 2. **Distracting**: Something that diverts attention away from the main focus. - *Example*: “His constant phone checking was quite distracting during our conversation.” 3. **Productivity**: The effectiveness of productive effort and how much work is accomplished. - *Example*: “His excessive screen time led to a decline in his productivity.” 4. **Anxious**: Feeling worried or uneasy, often related to social media interactions. - *Example*: “He would feel anxious when he didn’t receive instant feedback on his posts.” 5. **Candid conversation**: An open and honest discussion about a particular topic. - *Example*: “I had a candid conversation with him about his social media habits.” 6. **Rediscovered**: To find something again after losing contact with it; to re-engage with a passion or interest. - *Example*: “By limiting his screen time, he rediscovered his passion for sports.” ### Effective Use To effectively prepare for the topic: - Incorporate new vocabulary naturally into your speech. - Use personal anecdotes or relatable experiences to enhance your points. - Aim for a balance between discussing the negative aspects of technology usage and the solutions or improvements that emerged.
